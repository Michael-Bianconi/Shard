# AI

AI is at the heart of Shard. It controls how the guests, and murderer, behave
and interact with their environment.

## Guests
Guests can perform the following actions: 

1. Enter a room
2. Talk to the player about something they saw
3. Take an item
4. Drop an item

The actions that guests take are largely randomly. However, if they witness
something out of the ordinary, such as seeing a Guest follow another into
another room, they are more likely to remember that and talk to the player.

When a guest takes an item, they'll attempt to interact with it. For example,
a Guest may pick up a cup of tea and take a drink.

## Murderer
The murderer can perform these additional actions:

4. Kill a Guest
5. Set up a trap (such as poisoning food)

The murderer's goal is to kill every guest in the house, including the player.
However, the player has the advantage of taking the first action, before
the murderer, each turn.

The murderer has many methods of killing people, but he or she will attempt to
use as diverse an array of methods as possible. Possible murder methods involve
strangulation, bludgeoning, stabbing, poisoning, and environmental hazards such
as windows.

Each murder method leaves behind distinct clues - usually the murder weapon
or a torn piece of clothing.

In order to figure out who the murderer is, the player must talk to guests and
learn if a particular person was picked up the murder weapon, or had followed
the victim into another room.

Murderer's can also attempt to set up traps. If they have poison in their
possession, they can choose to spike a drink or food. If a guest consumes it,
they'll die.

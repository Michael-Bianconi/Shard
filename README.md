# Shard

## Overview
Shard is a mystery game akin to Agatha Christie's *And Then There Were None*.

The game begins with the player in a mansion with several NPCs. One of the
NPCs is the murderer, and it's up to the player to find out who.

The player can search for clues, interect with guests, and explore the mansion.
If the murdered gets the opportunity, he or she will murder one of the guests,
often leaving behind clues (but not always). It's up to the player to find out
who the murderer is before all the guests are killed. But be careful, if the
murderer thinks the player is onto them, they may try to kill the player
themselves.

## Guests
Each game, there are 10 guests, and one of them is the murderer. Each guest
has their own agenda, and will be seen milling around. Some brave (or tricky)
Guests may try to investigate on their own to try and find the killer.

The murderer will try to find any way possible to kill people, including
stabbing, bludgeoning, strangulation, and poison. He or she is skilled enough
that any attempt will be successful.

The player can talk to guests and try to learn information from them. However,
the guests are under no responsibility to tell the truth, and may even be
suspicious of the player.

## Rooms
The mansion has several interconnected rooms throughout. Some rooms have secret
passageways into other rooms, only accessible if the player has found certain
clues. It's safe to say that the murderer knows exactly where all the
secret passages are.

## Items
There are many, many items lying around in the mansion. Many are innocuous,
but many are also used as weapons, or clues. The murderer will no doubt
search for anything he or she could use as a weapon.

## Gameplay
Shard is semi-turn based. Each "tick", everybody in the mansion will perform
an action (or an inaction). That action may be moving into another room,
picking up an item, or *murdering a guest*.
